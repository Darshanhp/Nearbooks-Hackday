# Nearbooks
System to keep track of who has NS's books, that would enable us to see in real time where is a specific book, who has it and who's next to borrow it. We will use a QR code reader to make this easier. Created as an ASP.NET application using MVC and Web API for cerating RESTful HTTP services that can reach a mobile application developed with Android.
